Hello! 

This project is a Meal-Planning tool for those who would like to work on planning their meals weekly. This project uses Vite, React, and Redux.

AI Usage Notes

AI was used to help me plan out my project tasks throughout each week.

It was also used to troubleshoot and debug the Redux thunk issues that I was having.

I made sure to understand every part of the troubleshooting and debuggin issues.

I hope you enjoy this project.

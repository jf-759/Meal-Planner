Hello! 

This project is a Meal-Planning tool for those who would like to work on planning their meals weekly. This project uses Vite, React, and Redux.

**AI Usage Notes:**

AI was used to help me plan out my project tasks throughout each week.

It was also used to troubleshoot and debug the Redux thunk issues that I was having.

I made sure to understand every part of the troubleshooting and debuggin issues.

**Reflection:**

* If I had more time, I would look into saving the data so users can always come back and use this project for meal planning.


**How to use:**
* To see everything working in the terminal, you can write 'npm run dev'.
* You should be able to type in something into the search bar ie: Japanese, chicken, soup, etc.
* It should give you choices for each. 
* Then you should be able to add them to the weekly calendar and click on a recipe to view.

I hope you enjoy this project!
